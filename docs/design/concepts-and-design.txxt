                            dodot: 
              Manage your dotfiles like a butterfly


dodot is an open source dotfiles (configuration) manager.
This document explains the design and decisions behind its implementation.


The Problem Definition

    Configuration files are relevant and extensive enough to be source controlled. Setting up new 
    machines or environments easily, being able to revert or examine history, disaster resilience, 
    and even running small variations in parallel are all valuable capabilities.

    That in itself is obvious and trivialâ€”just keep the files in a repository. The issue is that 
    configuration files, to be useful, must be deployed - that is, they must be locatable at certain 
    path(s). That is the core definition for configuration management: a tool to give you centralized 
    control over your dotfiles that are easy to deploy and propagate any changes.


Yet Another One?

    Yes, unfortunately. While many dotfile managers exist, dodot takes a unique approach focused on 
    simplicity and directness.


dodot's Approach

    For starters: versioning is for version control. 
    
    1. Users should edit their configs as they always have
    2. No other tooling for editing or reloading: always done with no publishing/updating step.

    3. Simplicity: no state, ever. dodot is stateless and does things in a naive and straightforward manner.

    This is probably as straightforward as it gets, and yet most managers differ significantly from 
    this approach.

    The key is the heavy usage of symlinks. In the simple case of a config being a file, that's it.

    In the case of shell customizations, it does get a bit trickier, as many parts will customize 
    the shell.

    What dodot does is to create a directory that symlinks these various files in an ordered manner. 
    When you edit any of these, there is no extra step, and yet they remain under source control. 
    There are some caveats and edge cases to this, but in practice it works remarkably well.

Deployments, Not Installs

    A key aspect of dodot is the radical simplicity of the design. In a way, dotfiles managers are 
    somewhat like package managers, that can install, list, remove, and update configurations instead 
    of packages.

    Package managers are really, really hard to get right, and we've got a few that work pretty well. 
    It is a core principle not to walk the slippery slope of package-managers with dodot.

    There are no installs. There are no uninstalls, no upgrades. There is no on-disk data neither 
    conflicts from its divergence to the files on disk or deployed.

    This design does involve compromises, but it makes everything much simpler, much easier to reason 
    about, use, and debug.

        dodot deploy <pack>

    Will:
        - Loop through the requested packs (either passed as arguments or
        all in your DOTFILES_ROOT)
        - For each one, it will iterate the files and run them through the matchers. Firing matchers will pass 
        the trigger data for the appropriate power-up to handle.
        
        - In a broad sense everything becomes a list of : 
            - files to link
            - paths to be added to PATH
            - brew packages to be installed
            - scripts to be run
            - Scripts to be added to shell profile


    For this to work, however, all your files need to be independent. That is, running the operation 
    multiple times must be safe and produce the same result. For example: running brew install <formula> 
    is (pretty much) so. So are adding aliases, directories to your PATH, or scripts to your shell.

    This has another implication: updates are automatically deployed, but additions or removals are not. 
    Let's see an example:

        vim/
            .vimrc
            .vim/
                colors/
                    mycolor.vim

    The vim name will trigger a symlink power-up, which will symlink the .vimrc directly to ~/.vimrc. 
    Any updates you make to .vimrc or .vim are live, as all of these are symlinks.

    If you, however, deploy your vim pack, and later add a bin directory to it, this will not get 
    added to your PATH. You will need to run a new deploy.

    The same is true for deletions. Say you had an alias.sh file at deploy time, and then delete it. 
    That alias will be present on your shell until the next deploy.

    In practice, these are reasonable trade-offs. We edit things way more often than add, and 
    deployment is a safe command away.

    As long as you're okay with the two hard constraints dodot poses:

        - All files must be independent
        - No auto-magical additions or removals

    You'll enjoy a system that's easy to understand, use, and evolve.

Packs 

    dodot works by activating packs, that is deploying its configurations. Packs are a loose structure; 
    any directory under your DOTFILES_ROOT is a pack.

    That means you can organize packs any way you see fit: by software, stack, themes, or environments.

    dodot will process files inside packs in one of two ways:

        1. The file matches the naming conventions for special files, making it a trigger.
        Triggers activate specific power-ups for deployment.
        
        2. Otherwise, the file will be symlinked to the ~/ (or ~/.config) directory.
        Directories will be symlinked as well.

    This means that in dodot, you organize things in directories. What needs to be symlinked can just 
    be there, and what needs special handling has to follow the naming conventions (a .dodot file can 
    alter this behavior in case you want to override it).

    This gives users great flexibility with minimum effort or lock-in. Most of the time, the way dodot 
    works will work just as well for any other system or your personal scripts.

    So when processing packs, dodot matches file names against matchers.

Matchers

    Matchers are the configurable connection between file system state and power-ups that use it. 
    For example, the file name matcher is used by the alias power-up to get any file called alias.sh  
    in a pack. Matchers are a small, reusable library of configurable rules that power-ups can leverage, 
    freeing power-up authors from having to re-implement file scanning / power-up runs.

    Matchers consist of three parts:
        - Triggers: Pure matching logic (what files to match)
        - Power-ups: Pure processing logic (what to do with matched files)  
        - Configuration: Priority and options connecting triggers to power-ups

    This separation allows users to customize which files activate which behaviors without modifying 
    code, just configuration.

Power-Ups

    dodot's role is to process the files in your packs, handling them usefully. The various 
    capabilities for these come from the different power-ups.

    Each power-up knows how to deploy specific files in a pack, and are run by the presence of matchers.

    Here are the standard power-ups:

        link:
            Creates symlinks for files/directories. This is the default for
            unmatched files. Can target the user's home (`~`) or XDG config
            (`~/.config`).

        shell_add_path:
            Adds a directory (like `bin`) to the shell's PATH.

        homebrew:
            Installs packages from a Brewfile.

        shell_profile:
            Sources shell scripts (like aliases or profile additions) into
            the user's shell configuration.

        script_runner:
            Executes setup scripts for one-time initialization tasks.

    In order to have less code repetition and better control and consistency, power-ups don't do things 
    like symlinking a file or adding a path to PATH. For example, a power-up doesn't have to know the 
    details of the user shell-setup, or which other power-ups are producing scripts to be in the shell or not.

    Power-ups only return a description of the actions to be done.

Actions

    Power-ups don't perform filesystem operations directly. Instead, they return a list of Actions.
    Actions are high-level, declarative descriptions of intent. This allows the core engine to plan,
    validate, and preview all changes before execution. Standard actions include:

        - link: Create a symlink to a file or directory.
        - shell_source: Source a script into the user's shell profile.
        - shell_add_path: Add a directory to the PATH.
        - brew_install: Install a Homebrew formula.
        - script_run: Execute a script.

The Entire Cycle: 

    In a broad overview, when you run dodot <pack> <...pack n>
    1. Get configuration, resolve DOTFILES dir.
    2. Resolve pack name to paths, and validate (read access, no ignore, etc) 
    3. Through each pack: 
        0. Resolve configuration including the pack's toml (if there is one)
        1. run matchers and accumulate which ones fire 
        2. iterate the active matchers running their power-ups for each pack and accumulating their actions
        3. iterating their actions and transforming them into fsynth operations
        4. Execute all operations (the fsynth lib does the execution)

The first interesting point that up until 3.4 we have no side effects. Things are safe to run test and verify.
For an application that is mostly about changing files, this gives us a great deal of safety and testability.
    
We rely on the fsynth lib being well tested to guarantee these operation primitives work, but aside 
from that, we're good.


Customizing dodot's Behavior

    A key part of simplicity is not allowing too much customization. However, some aspects need this 
    flexibility to avoid dangerous situations.

    Inside a pack, a .dodot.toml file can be used to:

        ignore=true:
            dodot will ignore this directory entirely

        disable: [<power-up>]:
            dodot will ignore this power-up for this directory.
            For example if set to ["homebrew"] dodot will not run the brew
            install
        
        [[matchers.add]]:
            Adds a new, custom matcher for this pack. This allows for powerful
            customization without modifying code. For example:

            [[matchers.add]]
            trigger = {type = "file_name", patterns = ["*.zsh-theme"]}
            power_up = "link"
            priority = 90
            options = { base = "xdg_config" }


Running dodot

    The focus on simplicity is shown in the CLI. These are the commands:

        deploy [<pack>...]:
            Deploy the pack, creating symlinks and running power-ups. If no pack
            is specified, all packs will be deployed.
            
        info <pack>:
            Shows what in the pack would get triggered and what has already been
            deployed and the power-ups that will be run. It should be explicit 
            about *why* an action is proposed, for instance: "File 'bin/'
            matched trigger 'DirectoryTrigger("bin")', activating power-up
            'shell_add_path'".

        disable <path>:
            Disable a pack by creating or updating the .dodot.toml file

    And the following options are available:

        --dry-run:
            Show what would be done, but don't do it. This is useful to see
            what will be deployed and what will be ignored.

        --verbose
            Show more information about what is being done. This is useful
            to see what is being deployed and what is being ignored.

        --dotfiles-root 
            The root directory for your dotfiles, this overrides the environment
            variable.


The DOTFILES_ROOT

    The DOTFILES_ROOT is the root directory for your dotfiles. This is where dodot will look for packs.
    The most practical way to set it is the use of the $DOTFILES_ROOT environment variable.

    If no such variable is set, dodot will consider the current working directory as the root.


RECAP

    Set the DOTFILES_ROOT environment variable to the root of your dotfiles.
    Review the names of your files against matchers and make changes as needed.

    Double-check all of it is idempotent. Run dodot deploy.


    Shell-related power-ups

    Shell-related power-ups, aliases, and profiles, work in a slightly different way than regular 
    linking profiles.

    1. Install:
    User must add a source ~/.config/dodot/shell/init.sh to their shell
    
    2. At Deploy Time:
    dodot will create directories ~/.share/state/dodot/shell/aliases
    In it, dodot will write each pack's alias as a link as in:
        00-vim-alias.sh
        01-git-alias.sh
        
    3. On shell init:
    dodot will source the init.sh file, which will source all the
    aliases in the ~/.share/state/dodot/shell/aliases directory.

    This ensures a few things:
        - The order of the aliases is preserved
        - The aliases are not duplicated
        - Each deployment is immediate
        - Edits to any of these files are live
        - It's easy to inspect what is being done

    This is true for the alias, profile, and bin matchers.

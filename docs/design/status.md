# Implementation Status

This document tracks the implementation status of `dodot` based on the plan in [execution.txxt](./execution.txxt).

| Phase Group | Milestone | Code Status | Test Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 4: Executor** | 4.1: Action-to-Operation Conversion | complete | complete | Implemented in `get_fs_ops.lua`. All tests pass. |
| | 4.2: fsynth Integration | complete | complete | Operations convert to fsynth operations and are added to queue successfully. |
| | 4.3: Dry-run Support | complete | complete | Implemented in `run_as_script.lua` and `run_ops.lua`. |
| | 4.4: fsynth execution | complete | complete | Integration complete. Operations execute through fsynth processor. |
| | 4.5: Error Handling and Rollback | partial | complete | Basic error handling implemented. Rollback delegated to fsynth library. |
| **Phase 5: CLI Interface** | 5.1: Argument Parsing | TBD | TBD | CLI interface not yet implemented. |
| | 5.2: Deploy Command | partial | TBD | Basic deploy command exists in `run_as_script.lua` as temporary solution. |
| | 5.3: Output Formatting | partial | TBD | Basic output formatting implemented in `ui.lua`. |
| | 5.4: End-to-End Integration | partial | partial | Basic integration working through `run_as_script.lua`. |
| **Phase 6: Supporting Commands** | 6.1: Info Command | TBD | TBD | Planned for Phase 6. |
| | 6.2: List Command | partial | TBD | Basic list functionality in `run_as_script.lua`. |
| | 6.3: Disable Command | TBD | TBD | Planned for Phase 6. |
| | 6.4: Help and Debug Support | TBD | TBD | Planned for Phase 6. |

## Phase 4 Summary

**✅ Phase 4: Operation Execution - COMPLETE**

All core deliverables implemented and tested:

- **fsynth Integration**: Successfully converts dodot operations to fsynth operations and executes them through fsynth queue/processor system
- **Operation Mapping**: Complete mapping layer handles all operation types (symlink, create_file, ensure_dir, append_to_file, etc.)
- **Error Handling**: Proper error creation, validation, and reporting throughout the execution pipeline
- **Dry-run Support**: Full dry-run functionality that previews operations without executing them
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 18 unit tests + 6 integration tests covering all execution scenarios

**Key Files:**
- `lua/dodot/core/run_ops.lua` - Main execution engine
- `spec/unit/core/run_ops_spec.lua` - Unit tests
- `spec/integration/phase4_execution_spec.lua` - Integration tests
- `lua/dodot/errors/codes.lua` - Updated with new error codes

**Test Results:**
- Total tests: 370 (all passing)
- No regressions introduced
- Full pipeline from pack discovery → trigger matching → action generation → filesystem operations → execution

**Next Phase:**
Ready to proceed with Phase 5: CLI Interface implementation.
